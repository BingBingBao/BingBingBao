## **Projects**  

### **Transport & Logistics**
**Repo**: [Transport&Logistics](https://github.com/BingBingBao/Transport-Logistic)    


### **Reliability Engineering Repository**  
**Repo**: [Reliability Repository](https://github.com/BingBingBao/Reliability_Projects)   

Fault Diagnosis and Predictive Maintenance are core topics in Reliability Engineering. These techniques aim to prevent unexpected failures and optimize maintenance schedules, reducing downtime and repair costs in industrial systems.

This repository contains multiple projects focused on **vibration-based** condition monitoring and predictive maintenance using real-world datasets:

1. **Bearing Fault Diagnosis**: Analyzing vibration signals to detect faults in rotating machinery.
2. **Turbofan Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction**: Predicting the remaining time before engine failure.
3. **Circuit Breaker vibration signal condition Monitoring**: This project focuses on non-stationary vibration signals collected during CB switching operations. The vibration signals are first transformed into frequency-based Kurtogram images, which are then used to train a CNN for healthy/faulty classification.

These projects apply **machine learning, anomaly detection, and time-series forecasting** to improve industrial reliability.
