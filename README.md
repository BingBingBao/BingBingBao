## **Projects**  

### **Reliability Engineering Repository**  
**Repo**: [Reliability Repository](https://github.com/BingBingBao/Reliability_Projects)   

Fault Diagnosis and Predictive Maintenance are core topics in Reliability Engineering. These techniques aim to prevent unexpected failures and optimize maintenance schedules, reducing downtime and repair costs in industrial systems.

This repository contains two predictive maintenance projects using NASA datasets: 
1. **Bearing Fault Diagnosis** â†’ Analyzing vibration signals to detect faults in rotating machinery.
2. **Turbofan Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction** â†’ Predicting the remaining time before engine failure.

These projects apply **machine learning, deep learning, anomaly detection, and time-series forecasting** to improve industrial reliability.
